## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

### Continued development

Will do further research on **input[type="range]** to understand how it behave and use it easliy.

### Useful resources

- [In-depth Analysis on Input Range](https://css-tricks.com/sliding-nightmare-understanding-range-input/) - This helped me understand the behavior and content of sliders. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
